# Horse racing application

We have 4 horses: `Jasmine`, `Puffy`, `Scotty` and `Stormwind`.

They run by ajax to the related JSON files.

And now, we'll host a race between them.

So let them race together and the winner (the ajax that finished first) will be shown to the page.

How do you make a race? **Please write the race.js to make it work**

*We already have a bower.json file that setup with jQuery & bootstrap already. So just use them freely*
